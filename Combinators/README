The code in here was developed as part of SICL for parsing LOOP
clauses.  In order to turn it into a different system, it at least
needs a "packages" file and an ASDF system definition.

Currently, it uses a list of tokens as input to the parser.  Perhaps
there is some concept of a stream that one can use instead.  It can
not be an ordinary Common Lisp stream because the parser needs
unbounded backup.
